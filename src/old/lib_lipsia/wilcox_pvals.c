/*
* This is the actual routine that calculates the exact (two-tailed)
* level of significance for the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks
* test. The inputs are the Sum of Ranks of either the positive of
* negative samples (W) and the sample size (N).
* The Level of significance is calculated by checking for each
* possible outcome (2**N possibilities) whether the sum of ranks
* is larger than or equal to the observed Sum of Ranks (W).
*
* NOTE: The execution-time scales like ~ N*2**N, i.e., N*pow(2, N),
* which is more than exponential. Adding a single pair to the sample
* (i.e., increase N by 1) will more than double the time needed to
* complete the calculations (apart from an additive constant).
* The execution-time of this program can easily outrun your
* patience.
