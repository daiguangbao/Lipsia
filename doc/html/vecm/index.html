<p>
<div class="subtitle"><b>Background</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program 'vecm' computes eigenvector centrality maps (ECM).
ECM attributes a value to each voxel in the brain 
such that a voxel receives a large value if it is strongly correlated with many 
other nodes that are themselves central within the network. 
Google's PageRank algorithm is a variant of eigenvector centrality.
ECM produces a map in which each voxel has a value that indicates
its centrality. These maps can be used for subsequent statistical tests much like
contrast images in standard GLM analyses.<p>

</div>
<div class="subtitle"><b>Preparing input data</b></div>
<div class="content">
Preprocessed functional data serve as input to 'vecm'.
The preprocessing should normally include motion correction,
slicetime correction, spatial smoothing
and registration to some template (e.g. MNI or Talairach) resampled
to 3x3x3 mm^3 resolution. Higher resolutions (e.g. 2x2x2 mm^3) are 
generally not computable on standard hardware. 
It is important that baseline drifts are removed. 
See <a href="../START/index_prep.html"><u>standard preprocessing</u></a> chapter for more information on preprocessing.
<br><br>

Different experimental conditions may be contrasted provided the data are acquired
in separate runs. The length
of a run needed to produce reliable results depends on the specifics of the 
experimental design. Typically, a run lasts for several minutes. 
<br><br>
</div>
<div class="subtitle"><b>Defining a mask</b></div>
<div class="content">
A region of interest (ROI) must be specified beforehand using the option '-mask'.
The easiest way is to use the standard mask. It is located at 
/usr/share/lipsia/mask_3mm.v
<p>

To restrict the analysis to one hemisphere, a predefined mask may be used
and cut in half using the call, e.g.:

<br><br>
> <tt>vhemi -in mask.v -out mask_right.v -hemi right </tt>
<br><br>

Alternatively, a costumized mask may be defined using the program 'vledit'.
The program 'vledit' can also be used to refine an existing mask.
Note that 'vledit' only works on isotropic voxel grids.


<br><br>
It is essential that the mask is geometrically compatible with the
functional data and covers the desired portions of the brain. In particular,
the mask must have the same spatial resolution, the same image matrix size and
orientation as the functional data.
To check if the mask is correct, the following calls should be used:
<br><br>

> <tt> vtimestep -in functional.v -out tmp.v </tt> <br>
> <tt> vconvert -in mask.v -out zmask.v -repn float</tt> <br>
> <tt> vlv -in tmp.v -z zmask.v </tt><br><br>

The first call 'vtimestep' extracts the first time step (volume) from the
functional data. The second call converts the mask so that it can be 
visualized in the third call 'vlv'. If the mask aligns well with the
functional data and covers the desired parts of the brain then all is well
and the files 'tmp.v' and 'zmask.v' may be deleted. 
Otherwise, the mask must be redefined.
If the orientation is incorrect, use the program 'vflip3d'.

<br><br>

<p>
<div class="subtitle"><b>Hardware requirements</b></div>
<div class="content">
The size of computer main memory limits the size (number of voxels) that a mask can have.
For instance, an ECM processing using the standard mask provided in /usr/share/lipsia/mask_3mm.v
requires at least 6 GByte of main memory.
At 2x2x2 mm^3 resolution, full brain coverage is generally not possible on standard
computers. However, limiting the ROI to one hemisphere may help. The program
'vhemi' can be used for this purpose. 
</p>
<br><br>
</div>

<div class="subtitle"><b>Calling 'vecm'</b></div>
<div class="content">
Once the functional data are preprocessed and a mask is defined, the analysis can begin.
Computation times depend on computer hardware, size of the mask and length of the time series.
A full-brain coverage mask at 3x3x3 mm^3 and 200 time steps on a 3GHz cpu
requires about 10 minutes of computation time. 
Here is an example call using the standard mask.<br><br>

<tt><b><a href="#vecm"><u>vecm</u></a> 
-in functional.v -out ecm.v -mask /usr/share/lipsia/mask_3mm.v</b></tt><br><p>

<br></div>

<div class="subtitle"><b>Further infos</b></div>
<div class="content">
If the resulting ECMs are to be used in subsequent t-tests they need to be transformed
to ensure Gaussianity. This can be done using the program 'vgaussianize'.
For paired t-tests and twosample t-tests, special program options in 'vpaired-ttest'
and 'vtwosample-ttest' exist so that 'vgaussianize' is not needed.
It is also not needed if non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon's tests are used.
<p>
Note that ECM requires that entries in the correlation matrix must be
non-negative. This can be achieved in one of three ways: add +1 to all correlations,
take absolute values or set all negative correlations to zero.
The parameter '-type' of 'vecm' allows you to select one of these options.
