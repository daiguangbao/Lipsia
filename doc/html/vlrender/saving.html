<h1>Saving in vlrender</h1>
<p>'vlrender' can save the current view, export to an image and save
the zmap projection as zmap.</p>

<h2>Saving rendered image to file</h2>

<p>'vlrender' supports the export of the rendered image in three
common file-formats: Windows OS/2 Bitmap Graphics (*.bmp), Portable
(Public) Network Graphic (*.png) and Portable Pixelmap Graphic (*.ppm).</p>
<p>The rendered image can be saved to a file by selecting 'Export to
image' from the 'File'-Menu, selecting the disc icon at the toolbar or
by pressing 'E' at the keyboard and choosing the filename and folder.</p>
<p>Saving the image to disk might take some time, because it is
rendered in the highest possible quality. Also it is rendered without
the yellow lines which usually visualize the clipping object.</p>

<h2>Saving and restoring 'vlrender' views</h2>

<p>Having the current volume configured in rotation, size, position,
lighting and clipping, the configuration can be saved to a file, so that
it can be restored later or applied to other volumes with nearly the
same dimensions.</p>
<p>The current view can be saved/loaded by selecting 'Save/Load
View' from the 'File'-Menu.</p>
<p>Using an existing view configuration file, 'vlrender' can be
started from command-line with this given view. In combination with the
-out parameter the volume is immediateley rendered to an image file with
the given view without showing the vlrender-gui. This is the proposed
way for batch-mode processing.</p>

<h2>Saving the zmap projection</h2>

<p>If an zmap projection was created, it can be saved as a zmap by
selecting 'Export ZMap Projection' from the 'File'-Menu.</p>
<p>Be aware, that only the values in the thresholds are saved,
because they were used in the projection algorithms. If you want a full
projection, set the thresholds to the maximum value and create a new
projection using the projection button. This will definitly take a
while.</p>
