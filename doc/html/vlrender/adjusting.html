<h1>Adjusting the image</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>
The adjust the image, you can use the <i>Adjust Dialog</i>. To open it either press the
<img src="images/adjust.png" alt="Adjust Button" /> button or select <i>Adjust Rendering</i> in
the <i>Options</i> menu.
</p>
<img src="images/adjustdlg.png" alt="Adjust Dialog" />
<p>
As you can see the dialog has 3 states:
<h2>Rotation</h2>
<p>
In the rotation mode, you can rotate the rendered object. Each of the sliders in the second half of the dialog represents
one axis of the coordinate system. By moving a slider you rotate the rendered object.   
</p>
<h2>z-Values</h2>
<p>
If you activated the z-mapping, you only see values in two thresholds. With the two sliders, you can change these.
</p>
<p>
If you are in the projection mode, it will automaticly deactivated and a recalculation of the projection
is needed. You should also be aware, that the greater the thresholds, the more time it will take to
calculate the projection.
</p>
<h3>Opacity</h3>
<p>
'vlrender' clips voxel if there value is lower than a value. This value is called the lower Opacity.
</p>
<p>
Using the sliders for opacity it is possible to gain a better looking images than the image created by the default values.
So feel free to play with the sliders.</p>
<p>Only the anatomy data is effected by this values. The zmap remains the same.</p>
