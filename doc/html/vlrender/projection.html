<h1>Projecting a zmap</h1>
<p>
Zmap are volumes, like the anatomy data, but sometime it is desirable to have the
functional data only on the anatomy border. This is possible using the projection button
<img src="images/proj_button.gif" alt="Projection button" /> or simply press 'T'.
</p>
<p>
Be aware the projection may take some time. It also projects only the zmap-values inside
the zmap thresholds. If you change these thresholds, you have to recalculate the projection.
The greater the thresholds the longer the duration of the calculation.
</p>

<p>
After the calculation is finished the projection will rendered instead of the zmap. 
By clicking on the projection button, you can change the zmap render mode. If the 
thresholds of the zmap stay constant, no recalculation is needed and a cached projection
is used, so after the initial calculation the duaration of toggling the zmap mode depends on
the rendering time.
