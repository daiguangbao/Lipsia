<h1>Using VLRender</h1>
<p>After starting 'vlrender', you see the main window, rendering the
anatomy given throu the commandline option <i>-in</i>.</p>
<p>If a zmap was also loaded, the values of the zmap is rendered
too, using a threshold for positive and negative zmaps. These values can
be adjusted. (see <a href="adjusting.html">Adjusting the image</a>)</p>
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>If you move the mouse-cursor over the rendered volume, it will
change its shape to a little hand. By pressing and keeping pressed one
of the three mouse-buttons, the volume can be rotated (left button),
translated (middle button) and zoomed (right button) while moving the
mouse.</p>

<p>The speed of the rendering and thus the fluency of the display
and vlrender-gui depends strongly on the performance of the processor.
'vlrender' can be adapted in rendering speed and quality by changing the
slider at the bottom of the main window. Moving the slider to the left
will decrease the render quality and thus increase rendering speed.
Moving the slider to the right will behave vice versa.</p>
