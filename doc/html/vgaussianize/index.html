<div class="subtitle"><b>Background</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program 'vgaussianize' takes a set of images and transforms
them voxelwise such that their voxelwise distribution becomes normal.
It is typically applied to results from some analysis
procedure that was applied to data from a group of subjects where
the results cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.
A transformation step may be necessary so that subsequent t-tests may be performed.
<p>
In programs 'vpaired_ttest' and 'vtwosample_ttest' this step is included as 
an option so that it can be applied in a single call to thse programs.
It is however not included in 'v2ndlevel'.
<p>
Since the t-tests are done across data sets from all
subjects, the transformation must be done using all
data sets collectively. For example, if there
are 20 data sets from 20 subjects then the transformation is
applied voxelwise (assuming geometric correspondence between
data sets) such that at each voxel location 20 measurement
values exist. These 20 values should be approximately
normally distributed. This can be achieved by first assessing
their empirical distribution function (EDF), and then rescaling
them to mean + sigma*GaussInv(EDF). The exact form of this
transformation is described by Albada et al (2007).

<div class="subtitle"><b>Usage</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program 'vgaussianize' is applied to a set of images which may be specified 
using wildcards. It generates output images whose filenames are derived from
the input filename by adding a prefix 'gauss_' to all input filenames.
The the example below, the output filenames will be called 'gauss_functional_*.v'
and will reside in the same directory as the inputs.
