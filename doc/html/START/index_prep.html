<div class="toptitle">LIPSIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting started: preprocessing</div>

<div class="subtitle">The standard preprocessing pipeline</div>
<div class="content">


<p>As a first, fMRI data should be preprocessed using a sequence of processing steps described
below. Several different preprocessing strategies are possible. However, to get started,
we suggest to use the following pipeline.


<p>The very first step is data conversion. Let us assume that the data have been acquired in
the DICOM data format and reside in a directory called "/scr/dicom/data". Lets us further assume that
the functional scan we are interested in is in the subdirectory called "/scr/dicom/data/2".
We now need to converted these functional data into the lipsia-format using the following call:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vvinidi/index.html"><u>vvinidi</u></a> -in /scr/dicom/data/2 -out data.v -rf dcm</b></tt><br></p>
Note that the '-rf dcm' parameter is only necessary if the dicom files have no suffix.<br><br>

Now view the data:
<p><tt><b><a href="../vqview/index.html"><u>vqview</u></a> -in data.v</b></tt><br></p>

Check for image artefacts such as subject motion and
in particular, check the dynamic range. If values are within a small range (less than 300 or so),
it may be advisable to apply a scaling by a constant factor:

<p><tt><b>vnormvals -in data.v -scale 10 -out data1.v</b></tt><br></p>

The next step is the correction for slicetiming. This is necessary as slices are not acquired simultaneously
so that their temporal offset distort results. Note however, that this step should only be performed
if the repetition time is not too long (about 3 seconds or less).

<p><tt><b><a href="../vslicetime/slicetime.html"><u>vslicetime</u></a> -in data1.v -out data2.v</b></tt><br></p>


As subjects may have moved during the scanning, we now apply a correction for motion:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vmovcorrection/index.html"><u>vmovcorrection</u></a> -in data2.v 
-out data3.v -report list.txt</b></tt><br></p>

The text file "list.txt" contains information about translation and rotation parameters describing the
motion. This file may later be used as a covariate in statistical tests. It can also be used to check for
excessive motion leading to exclusion of the data set.<br>
The next step will be a registration of the functional data to the MNI brain. Here we distinguish between two approaches.
<br>
</div>
<div class="subtitle">Registration using an anatomical scan</div> 
<div class="content">
Lets consider having the functional scan and the corresponding anatomical scan (e.g. anatomical.v). Here we can use the anatomical scan to find a transformation which aligns the anatomical data to the MNI brain and then apply this transform to our functional data.<br>
To find the transform of the anatomical scan to the MNI brain you have to call:
<p><tt><b><a href="../valigned3d/index.html"><u>valign3d</u></a> -in anatomical.v -ref mni.v
-trans trans.nii -transform 0 1 2 -optimizer 0 0 2 -bound 10 -prealign_m -iter 1000 1000 100
</b></tt><br></p>
The next call applies the transform trans.nii to the functional data data3.v.<br>

<p><tt><b><a href="../vdotrans3d/vdotrans3d.html"><u>vdotrans3d</u></a> -in data3.v -out data4.v -trans trans.nii
-res 3 -fmri</b></tt><br></p>
</div>
<div class="subtitle">Registration without an anatomical scan</div> 
<div class="content">
If you have no anatomical scan of your subject you can also use your functional data for finding the transform to the MNI brain. Therefore you have to call:
<p><tt><b><a href="../valigned3d/index.html"><u>valign3d</u></a> -in data3.v -ref mni.v
-trans trans.nii -transform 0 2 -optimizer 0 2 -bound 10 -smooth 2 -prealign_m -iter 1000 1000
</b></tt><br></p>

valign3d will take the first timestep of the functional scan and use it to search the transform to the MNI brain. So now all you have to do is applying this transform to your functional data:<br>

<p><tt><b><a href="../vdotrans3d/vdotrans3d.html"><u>vdotrans3d</u></a> -in data3.v -out data4.v -trans trans.nii
-res 3 -fmri</b></tt><br></p>


<p> The final step of the preprocessing pipeline is to remove baseline drifts and spatial smoothing.
<p><u>Spatial filtering</u> is used to increase the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and to reduce
the between subject variability for group studies. In our example, we will apply a spatial 3D Gaussian filter
with a filter size of 6 mm FWHM (full width half maximum).</p>

<p><u>Temporal filtering</u> can be used to remove drifts within the signal over time using a frequency
filter. As a rule of thumb we suggest to remove low frequencies below 1/90 Hz. For some types of analysis
itit is also advisable to remove high frequencies above 1/10 Hz. The following call performs these operations:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vpreprocess/index.html"><u>vpreprocess</u></a> -in data4.v -out data5.v -fwhm 6 -low 10 -high 90</b></tt><br></p>
 
This concludes the preprocessing pipeline. The preprocessed data are now in the file 'data5.v'.
