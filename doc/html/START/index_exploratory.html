<div class="toptitle">LIPSIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting started: exploratory analysis</div>

<div class="subtitle">Exploratory analysis</div>
<div class="content">


<p>After the data have been preprocessed, further analysis steps can be performed.
In the following, we describe some exploratory analysis procedures. They may be particularly
useful for so-called "resting-state" experiments, but also for other types of experiments.
</div>

<div class="subtitle">Defining masks</div>
<div class="content">

Some of the procedures described below require a region of interest (mask) to which the
analysis is restricted. A whole brain mask at 3x3x3 mm resolution is located in
<tt>/usr/share/lipsia/mask_3x3x3.v</tt>. It fits to the EPI-template to which data
are registered in our proposed standard preprocessing pipeline. To check if this mask
is okay for your data, do the following. First change to the directory where your preprocessed
data reside:<p>

<tt> > cd /scr/experiment_1/prep</tt><p>

and select timepoints from several data sets, e.g.:<p>

<tt> > vtimestep -in data_sub001.v -out a_sub001.v</tt><p>
<tt> > vtimestep -in data_sub002.v -out a_sub002.v</tt><p>

and average them<p>
<tt> > vave -in a_sub*.v -out mean.v</tt><p>

Now convert the mask to make it suitable for viewing:<p>

<tt> > vconvert -in /usr/share/lipsia/mask_3x3x3.v -out z.v -repn float</tt><p>

and view it overlaid onto the mean of the functional data:<p>

<tt> > vlv -in mean -z z.v</tt><p>

If the the functional data and the mask match well, then you may use it.
If there is a mismatch, then edit it using <a href="../vledit/vledit.html"><u>vledit</u></a>.


</div>
<div class="subtitle">Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM)</div>
<div class="content">

To perform eigenvector centrality mapping, define a mask as described above, and
perform the preprocessing steps described in the previous section using an isotropic resolution
of 3x3x3 mm. The preprocessed data are in the file called "data.v". Then type on the command line:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vecm/vecm.html"><u>vecm</u></a> -in data.v -mask mask.v -out ecm_subj001.v</b></tt><br></p>

and view the result:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vlv/vlv.html"><u>vlv</u></a> -in /usr/share/lipsia/mni.v -z ecm_subj001.v& </b></tt><br></p>

If more than one data set needs to be processed, it is more convenient to use shell scripts (see section
"shell scripts").
After all data sets have been processed, statistical analysis can begin. For instance, assume that
a group of 16 subjects has been scanned in two different conditions, and the resulting
maps are called "ecm1_subj*.v" and "ecm2_subj*.v". The '*' is a wildcard representing all 16 data sets.
To obtain a map showing differences between the two conditions, type

<p><tt><b><a href="../vpaired_ttest/vpaired_ttest.html"><u>vpaired_ttest</u></a> -in1 ecm1_subj*.v
-in2 ecm2_subj*.v -out zmap.v -gauss true</b></tt><br></p>

and view the result:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vlv/vlv.html"><u>vlv</u></a> -in /usr/share/lipsia/mni.v -z zmap.v& </b></tt><br></p>

The file 'zmap.v' contains uncorrected z-values showing the difference between the two conditions.
Using a standard colour map, the red values show voxels where condition 1 had higher centrality than
condition 2, and blue shows the reverse.

</div>
<div class="subtitle">Powerspectrum analysis</div>
<div class="content">

Performing a powerspectrum analysis is done analogously to an ECM analysis. First do a preprocessing
as described before. Note that for powerspecteal analysis the spatial resolution may now be different from
3x3x3 mm. The preprocessed data are in the file called "data.v". Then type on the command line:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vpowerspectrum/vpowerspectrum.html"><u>vpowerspectrum</u></a> -in data.v 
-out pow_subj001.v -type range -low 20 -high 90</b></tt><br></p>

and view the result:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vlv/vlv.html"><u>vlv</u></a> -in /usr/share/lipsia/mni.v -z pow_subj001.v& </b></tt><br></p>

The result shows the fractional power within the range 1/20 Hz to 1/90 Hz.
If more than one data set needs to be processed, it is more convenient to use shell scripts (see section
"shell scripts").
After all data sets have been processed, statistical analysis can begin. For instance, assume that
a group of 16 subjects has been scanned in two different conditions, and the resulting
maps are called "pow1_subj*.v" and "pow2_subj*.v". The '*' is a wildcard representing all 16 data sets.
To obtain a map showing differences between the two conditions, type

<p><tt><b><a href="../vpaired_ttest/vpaired_ttest.html"><u>vpaired_ttest</u></a> -in1 pow_subj*.v
-in2 pow_subj*.v -out zmap.v -gauss true</b></tt><br></p>

and view the result:

<p><tt><b><a href="../vlv/vlv.html"><u>vlv</u></a> -in /usr/share/lipsia/mni.v -z zmap.v& </b></tt><br></p>

The file 'zmap.v' contains uncorrected z-values showing the difference between the two conditions.
Using a standard colour map, the red values show voxels where condition 1 had more power than
condition 2, and blue shows the reverse.
