Lipsia is based on Vista that is a data format and a software environment 
for computer vision research. It is designed to support not only images, 
but also edge sets, camera models, and more complex data structures. 
Vista includes libraries of common computer vision and image processing 
algorithms. It is written in ANSI C, for UNIX platforms running X Windows, 
and it is freely available. 

Further information can be found on the Vista homepage:

The program 'vwhiteglm' performs a general linear regression with pre-whitening. 
It fits a linear model to fMRI time series. In a first stage, autocorrelation 
parameters are estimated from the least squares residuals using the Yule-Walker 
equations. Then, the autocorrelation parameters are used to 'whiten' the data 
and the design matrix. In a second stage, the linear model is re-estimated using 
least squares on the whitened data to produce estimates of effects and their 
standard errors.

This approach was developed and implemented by Keith Worsley in the 'FMRISTAT'
software package.
